After the city elections in 2025, I heard that the people of Franklin wanted to hear more from their councilors. I will try to keep this updated before regular city council meetings with a post detailing what I think will be discussed and my understandings of the issues on the agenda. I will work to get this out prior to the meetings - hopefully this will get folks coming to public comment. If not in public comment, then contact me via email at sjacobson@franklinnh.gov.\n\nWho is this for?\n\n\nThe People\n\nThis is for anyone who lives in Franklin that is trying to get a better sense of what is happening, and what may be upcoming on the City agenda.",
