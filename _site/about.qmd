<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

This is a publig blog for the residents of Franklin New Hampshire. After the city elections in 2025, I heard that the people of Franklin wanted to hear more from their councilors. I will try to keep this updated before regular city council meetings with a post detailing what I think will be discussed and my understandings of the issues on the agenda. I will work to get this out prior to the meetings - hopefully this will get folks coming to public comment. If not in public comment, then contact me via email at sjacobson\@franklinnh.gov.

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>

<h3>The People</h3>

This is for anyone who lives in Franklin that is trying to get a better sense of what is happening, and what may be upcoming on the City agenda.
